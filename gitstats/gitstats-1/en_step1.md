# Introducing Git

Git is a distributed version control system that enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently. It tracks changes in source code during development, allowing teams to work concurrently without conflicts. Git provides a snapshot-based approach, recording changes in a series of commits. Each commit represents a set of modifications, creating a comprehensive history of the project. Additionally, Git facilitates branching, enabling developers to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
