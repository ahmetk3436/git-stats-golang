# What is DataSource?

DataSource is the source from which data is retrieved within Grafana. Grafana can integrate with a variety of different data sources and visualize data from these sources. Here are some of the data sources supported by Grafana:

1. **Prometheus:** By adding Prometheus as a data source, you can use metric data coming from Prometheus, an open-source system monitoring and alerting tool.

2. **InfluxDB:** With integration to InfluxDB, a high-performance time series database, you can visualize time series data.

3. **Elasticsearch:** Integrated with Elasticsearch, Grafana allows searching and visualizing large amounts of data.

4. **MySQL/PostgreSQL:** You can visualize data from relational databases in Grafana.
