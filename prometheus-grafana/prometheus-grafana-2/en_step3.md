# What is Alert Manager ?

**Alert Manager** is an open-source alert management tool commonly used with Prometheus. It processes alerts generated by Prometheus and manages these alerts based on specific rules. Alertmanager provides system operators and developers with the ability to organize, filter, and have more control over alerts.

### How It Works

1. **Alert Generation:** Prometheus generates alerts when a certain metric or state exceeds a defined threshold.

2. **Alert Processing:** The generated alerts are received and processed by Alertmanager.

3. **Filtering and Routing:** Alert Manager filters alerts based on defined rules and configurations, then routes them to specific targets.

4. **Notification to Humans or Systems:** Alert Manager sends the filtered alerts to designated notification channels (Email, Slack, Webhook, etc.), notifying relevant individuals or systems.

## Example Yaml
```yaml
route:
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 3h
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'

receivers:
- name: 'slack-notifications'
  slack_configs:
  - send_resolved: true
    username: 'alertmanager'
    channel: '#alerts'
```
