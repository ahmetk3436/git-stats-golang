# Pull-Based vs Push-Based APM Systems Comparison

## Pull-Based APM Systems

Pull-based APM systems retrieve monitoring data from a central source that requests the data. These systems pull data at specific intervals and process the data received from monitoring servers.

### Advantages

- Lighter resource usage: Data is only received when requested, making resource usage more efficient.
- Less network traffic: Lower network traffic due to reduced data retrieval frequency.

### Disadvantages

- Delayed monitoring: Real-time monitoring is not achievable as data is pulled at specific intervals.

## Push-Based APM Systems

Push-based APM systems actively receive monitoring data continuously from actively monitored sources. These systems push monitoring data to the server in real-time.

### Advantages

- Real-time monitoring: Continuous data transmission enables real-time monitoring.
- Instant alerts: Immediate alerts can be received when issues arise.

### Disadvantages

- Higher resource usage: Continuous data transmission may consume more resources.
- Higher network traffic: Constant data transmission may lead to increased network traffic.

## Comparison

| Features                | Pull-Based APM   | Push-Based APM   |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Real-Time Monitoring    | No               | Yes              |
| Resource Usage          | Lighter          | Heavier          |
| Network Traffic Amount  | Lower            | Higher           |
| Alerts                  | Delayed          | Instant          |

The advantages and disadvantages of each model should be evaluated based on the specific needs of the application and use-case scenarios.
